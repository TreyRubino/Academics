# Understanding Recursive Rules for Tree Structures in Prolog

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of recursive rules to define and evaluate relationships within an N-ary tree structure in Prolog. The relationships covered include ancestor, descendant, sibling, and same-level checks. Each rule leverages recursion to efficiently navigate the tree hierarchy (DFS), enabling dynamic querying without explicitly mapping each path.

## N-ary Tree Structure

The N-ary tree is defined with `node(Value, Children)` structures, where each node consists of a value and a list of child nodes. Below is the definition used in the Prolog file:

```prolog
tree(node(a, [
    node(b, [
        node(e, [
            node(k, [])
        ]),
        node(f, [
            node(l, []),
            node(m, [
                node(t, [])
            ])
        ])
    ]),
    node(c, [
        node(g, []),
        node(h, [
            node(n, [])
        ]),
        node(i, [
            node(o, []),
            node(p, [])
        ])
    ]),
    node(d, [
        node(j, [
            node(q, []),
            node(r, []), 
            node(s, [])
        ])
    ])
])).
```

In this structure:

- `node(a, [...])` is the root node, containing child nodes b, c, and d.
- Each node can contain its own list of children, allowing representation of complex hierarchical relationships.

This structure enables the recursive rules for ancestor, descendant, sibling, and same-level relationships by organizing the tree in a way that Prolog can traverse efficiently and easily readable.

## Relationships Defined

The key relationships explored in the Prolog file are as follows:

- **Ancestor**: A node \(X\) is an ancestor of \(Y\) if \(Y\) is directly or indirectly under \(X\) in the tree. The recursive rule searches through all descendants of \(X\), only succeeding if it finds \(Y\) along this path. This recursive rule works by checking three cases:
  
    - **Base case**: \(Y\) is a direct child of \(X\), meaning \(X\) is an immediate parent of \(Y\).
      ```prolog
      ancestor_in_tree(X, Y, node(X, Children)) :-
          member(node(Y, _), Children).
      ```
  
    - **Descendant check within \(X\)'s subtree**: If \(Y\) is not an immediate child, the rule looks deeper within \(X\)’s subtree to see if \(Y\) is nested further down. This recursive search is restricted to \(X\)’s descendants only, as nodes outside this subtree cannot be \(Y\)'s ancestors.
      ```prolog
      ancestor_in_tree(X, Y, node(X, Children)) :-
          member(Child, Children),
          ancestor_in_tree(X, Y, Child).
      ```
  
    - **Full tree traversal**: If \(X\) is not at the current root, the rule traverses the entire tree to locate \(X\), ensuring the ancestor relationship can be checked no matter where \(X\) is in the tree.
      ```prolog
      ancestor_in_tree(X, Y, node(_, Children)) :-
          member(Child, Children),
          ancestor_in_tree(X, Y, Child).
      ```

- **Descendant**: A node \(X\) is a descendant of \(Y\) if \(Y\) is an ancestor of \(X\). This relationship is defined by referencing the ancestor rule, which simplifies the code by allowing the ancestor relationship to be used in reverse. By doing so, we avoid redundant checks and let Prolog confirm that \(X\) is a descendant by verifying that \(Y\) is one of \(X\)’s ancestors, covering both direct and indirect descent.
    ```prolog
    descendant(X, Y) :-
        ancestor(Y, X).
    ```

- **Sibling**: Nodes \(X\) and \(Y\) are siblings if they share the same parent node. The sibling rule checks that \(X\) and \(Y\) both appear in the children list of a common parent node. This rule involves two parts:
  
    - **Base case**: The rule checks if \(X\) and \(Y\) are children of the same parent node directly.
      ```prolog
      sibling_in_tree(X, Y, node(_, Children)) :-
          member(node(X, _), Children),
          member(node(Y, _), Children),
          X \= Y.
      ```
  
    - **Tree traversal**: If \(X\) and \(Y\) aren’t immediately found as siblings, the rule traverses the tree to locate them in each node’s list of children, ensuring that all sibling relationships are covered across different levels of the tree.
      ```prolog
      sibling_in_tree(X, Y, node(_, Children)) :-
          member(Child, Children),
          sibling_in_tree(X, Y, Child).
      ```

- **Same-Level**: Nodes \(X\) and \(Y\) are at the same level if they share the same depth from the root node. This is determined by a depth-calculation rule:
  
    - **Depth calculation**: The `level` rule recursively calculates the depth of each node by moving down the tree and incrementing the depth for each level. For each node, if a child node exists, the depth is incremented by 1.
      ```prolog
      level(node(Value, _), Value, 0).
      ```

    - **Recursive case**: This rule recursively calculates the depth for each child node. When a child is found with a matching value, the depth is incremented by 1 for each level down.
      ```prolog
      level(node(_, Children), Value, Depth) :-
          member(Child, Children),
          level(Child, Value, ChildDepth),
          Depth is ChildDepth + 1.
      ```

    - **Depth comparison**: After calculating the depths of both \(X\) and \(Y\), Prolog checks if the depths are equal, confirming that the nodes are equidistant from the root and therefore on the same level.
      ```prolog
      same_level(X, Y) :-
          tree(Tree),
          level(Tree, X, DepthX),
          level(Tree, Y, DepthY),
          DepthX =:= DepthY.
      ```
