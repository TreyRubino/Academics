# Logical Laws in Prolog Predicates
by Trey Rubino

## Section 1: Arithmetic and Lists

This section explores the logical laws underlying the Prolog predicates factorial/2, assoc/3, and nth/3 (as well as a section of escape_room). Since this project closely aligns with topics we've covered (and are currently covering) in CPSC 225, I chose to delve into the logical foundations of these predicates rather than focusing solely on the code implementation.

### 1. Identity Law (Base Case)

Each Prolog predicate includes a **base case**, which represents a fixed solution when a certain condition is met. This base case serves as a foundation for recursion, ensuring that each predicate has a terminating condition.

#### Identity Law in Propositional Logic
The **Identity Law** can be expressed in propositional logic as:

$$P \land \text{True} \equiv P$$

In Prolog
- `factorial(0, 1)` asserts that the factorial of 0 is always 1.
- `assoc(Property, [[Property, Value]|_], Value)` checks if the desired `Property` is the first item in the list.
- `nth(0, [Elt|_], Elt)` retrieves the element at index 0.

These base cases follow the **Identity Law** because they provide direct results without requiring further computation.

---

### 2. Induction and Transitivity (Recursive Step)

Each predicate relies on **recursive calls**, which is a form of **inductive reasoning**. By assuming the predicate holds for the current step, the recursive case ensures it will hold for the next step.

#### Inductive Reasoning in Propositional Logic

Induction can be expressed as:

1. **Base Case**: Prove that \( P(0) \) holds.
2. **Inductive Step**: 
   1. P(n) holds for all (n) if:

$$(P(n) \rightarrow P(n + 1))$$ 

In Prolog:
- **`factorial(N, Result)`** calculates `Result` by assuming the factorial of \( N - 1 \) is already computed. For example, assuming `factorial(N - 1, Result1)`, it calculates `Result` as `N * Result1`.
- **`assoc/3`** searches through the list recursively until it finds `Property`. If `Property` isn’t at the head, the call proceeds to the tail.
- **`nth/3`** decrements `N` in each call, assuming the result of `nth(N - 1, Tail, Elt)` brings it closer to the solution.

#### Transitivity of Equality in Propositional Logic

In recursive predicates, **transitivity** is applied as follows: 

$$(P = Q \land Q = R) \rightarrow P = R$$ 

In `factorial/2`, this translates to:

$$\text{factorial}(N, Result) = N \times \text{factorial}(N - 1, Result1)$$

This chaining continues until `factorial(0, 1)` is reached.

---

### 3. Modus Ponens (Implication)

Each recursive call in Prolog uses **modus ponens** to determine if it should proceed with the next step. In logical terms, **modus ponens** states:

$$(P \rightarrow Q) \land P \rightarrow Q$$

In Prolog:
- **`factorial(N, Result)`** proceeds only if \( N > 0 \).
- **`assoc/3`** continues searching the list if `Property` does not match the head.
- **`nth/3`** proceeds to the next element if \( N > 0 \).

---

### 4. Conjunction (Combining Conditions)

In each predicate, conjunction ensures that multiple conditions must hold simultaneously for recursion to continue.

#### Conjunction in Propositional Logic

In propositional logic, conjunction is represented as:

$$P \land Q \rightarrow R$$

In Prolog:
- In `factorial(N, Result)`, the conditions \( N > 0 \) and `Result is N * Result1` must both be true.
- In `assoc/3`, each recursive call requires that the current list element doesn’t match `Property`.
- In `nth/3`, `N > 0` and `PreviousN is N - 1` must both hold for the recursion to proceed.

--- 

### Summary of Observed Laws in Section 1
- **Identity Law**: Base cases in each predicate serve as identity elements, providing direct solutions without further computation. 
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Each recursive predicate relies on inductive reasoning to ensure it holds for successive steps.
- **Transitivity of Equality**: Recursive predicates like `factorial/2` use transitivity to chain equalities step-by-step until the base case is reached.
- **Modus Ponens**: Each recursive call in Prolog applies Modus Ponens to determine if the next step is valid. 
- **Conjunction**: Multiple conditions must hold simultaneously for recursion to continue.

## Section 2: Escape Game Predicates

The `escape/2` predicate models a scenario where a person attempts to escape a room by performing a sequence of actions. Due to the sequential nature of actions and states, **Section 2** uses additional logical laws beyond those found in **Section 1**.

### Additional Logical Laws Used in `escape/2`

### 1. Disjunction (Logical OR)

In the `escape/2` predicate, **disjunction** (logical OR) is implicitly used to explore multiple possible paths to escape. Each possible action serves as an option for the next state, creating a branching effect in the search for a solution.

#### Disjunction in Propositional Logic

The disjunction law states:

$$
P \lor Q
$$

This means that either \( P \) or \( Q \) can be true to proceed with the logic. In `escape/2`, this corresponds to choosing between multiple actions at any given state. For example, if `State1` has two possible actions, `Action1` and `Action2`, Prolog will try one path and, if it fails, backtrack and attempt the other. This branching is a form of disjunction.

---

### 2. Existential Quantification (There Exists)

**Existential quantification** is used to express that at least one solution path exists. In `escape/2`, this corresponds to finding at least one sequence of actions that leads to the `free` state, rather than needing every possible action sequence to lead there.

#### Existential Quantification in Propositional Logic

Existential quantification can be expressed as:

$$
\exists x \, (P(x))
$$

This means:
> There exists at least one `x` for which \( P(x) \) is true.

In `escape/2`, this quantification applies to the entire solution search:
> There exists a sequence of actions that results in a successful escape.

This contrasts with Section 1, where each predicate aims to compute a single deterministic result without exploring multiple solutions.

---

### 3. Goal-Driven Search (Resolution)

**Goal-driven search** is the process of working backwards from a desired goal to determine the sequence of actions that can achieve it. In Prolog, this is represented by attempting to match the `free` state in the `escape/2` predicate and recursively determining how to reach it.

#### Goal-Driven Search in Propositional Logic

This can be represented as:

$$
\text{goal} \rightarrow \text{actions}
$$

In Prolog, goal-driven search involves unifying with the desired final state and determining which preceding actions lead to it. In `escape/2`, the goal is `state(_, _, _, free)`, and Prolog works backward through possible actions to achieve this.

This differs from the predicates in Section 1, where there is no "goal state" or backwards search.

---

### Summary of Observed Laws in `escape/2`

- **Disjunction**: Explores multiple possible actions to achieve escape.
- **Existential Quantification**: Ensures that at least one solution path exists.
- **Goal-Driven Search**: Focuses on achieving the `free` state through backward reasoning.
